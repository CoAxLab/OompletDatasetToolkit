# TIER-Template
Directory architecture according to TIER Protocol 4.0

This repository is a resource for CoAx Lab members who are beginning a new project. Clone locally to use the TIER directory architecture. Create your data pipeline files in their respective directory.

This structure is flexible; remove any directories that may not apply to your project, and add any directories unique to your project.
